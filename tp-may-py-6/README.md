#### About Project 

Scraper tools, that uses sentimental analysis, are one of the most interesting and happening things to work with. This project, thus, aims at building an election scraper that scraps tweets on Twitter, to give predictions based on sentiment checks. It combines both web scraping and data mining as we go on to extract data in form of tweets and try to derive valuable insights and recent trends based on this data. It will let us explore tweepy, pandas, numpy, re and other important modules that python brings in, while creating the necessary python environment to work on this project.
