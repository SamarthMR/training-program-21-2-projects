#### About Project 
the idea of this project is to provide a simple GUI application to user to get the current temperature of any city they wish to see ,the system also provide a simple user interface for simplification of application, The features of this application will be that this will be a real time weather forecast ,this show the name of the location and state of the location and it also show the country where the location belongs to ,and when we give the input as a location then it shows the weather report of the particular location and the day and the temperature present in that location and it works really like an app and gives the minimum information required for the user and in this project we have to import the bs4 library from and have to link the report to it so it will display the time state ,country ,time ,temperature.
